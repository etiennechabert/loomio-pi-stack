<h3>⚠️ Important Security Guidelines:</h3>

<p><strong>Please create a STRONG password:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>DO NOT reuse passwords from other websites or platforms</strong><br/>
      <em>This is self-hosted infrastructure. Even though passwords are encrypted, you should treat this as a separate, independent system.</em></li>
  <li>Use at least <strong>16 characters</strong> (longer is better!)</li>
  <li>Consider using a passphrase like <strong>"correct-horse-battery-staple"</strong> (easy to remember, hard to crack)</li>
  <li>Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols</li>
  <li>Avoid common passwords like "Password123" or simple patterns</li>
  <li>Never share your password with anyone</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> While we use industry-standard encryption (bcrypt), this is a self-hosted platform. Using a unique password ensures that if any system is ever compromised, your other accounts remain secure.</p>
